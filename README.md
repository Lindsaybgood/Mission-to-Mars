## Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
This project consisted on a Python script to scrape text and images from various websites that talked about Mission to Mars. I created a web application with Flask that will automatically scrape different websites to extract data about the Mission to Mars, store it in a NoSQL database and display the latest information on a HTML page.
